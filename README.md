In order to use most aws tools you need  
1) Establish an account that has access keys
2) User these access keys to perfrom actions with the cli

You can make the account using IAM and give the account limited or all access on your account  
The access key is like a username and password  
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID == username    
AWS_SECRET_KEY_ID == password  

You should protect both of them like becase they are credentials   

You can follow these steps to add aws cli to your computer
